# Test Particle Simulations of Cosmic Rays on GPUs

This program's main purpose is the simulation of test particles in isotropically turbulent magnetic fields,
by numerically integrating the equations of motion using a Nvidia GPU. Moreover it can be used to perfom said
simulation using the CPU, run a test of different numerical integrators and generate isotropic turbulent
fields as well as evaluate those fields in a grid for further analysis.
The program was developed during my bachelor's thesis "test particle simulations of cosmic rays on GPUs"
supervised by Prof. Philipp Mertsch and Dr. Vo Hong Minh Phan at RWTH University.
